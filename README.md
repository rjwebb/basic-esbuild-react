# very basic react esbuild template

this one basically doesn't do anything!
it has a few yarn commands:
- `yarn run build` - builds `src/main.tsx` and puts the output in `public/main.js`
- `yarn run start` - does the above and hosts the files on a dev server

TODO: live reloading - can i do this without writing another config file?
